I'm a second-year PhD student working with Dr. Adam Charles at the 
[Department of Biomedical Engineering](https://www.bme.jhu.edu/).  At the [Neural Signals Lab](https://www.bme.jhu.edu/ascharles/), I am developing algorithms for closed-loop brain-computer interfaces, with a focus on cerebellar applications. My research interest is on using data from high-density electrophysiology recordings to decode the brain’s dynamical states and design stimulation protocols that could eventually support cerebellar prostheses.

More broadly, I’m excited about applying ideas from dynamical systems theory, machine learning, and control systems to understand and interact with neural circuits in real time.

I received my B.A. degree in Mathematics (Statistics) and Biology (CMG) from Boston University. Afterwards, I worked as a Technical Associate at the [Picower Institute of Learning and Memory](https://picower.mit.edu/) under the supervision of [Dr. Emery. N. Brown.](https://picower.mit.edu/emery-n-brown). Working at the [Neural Statistics Research Laboratory](https://www.neurostat.mit.edu/) helped me gained an interest in Computational Neuroscience.
